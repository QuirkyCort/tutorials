# Variables and Types

<div class="important">
Before you start, make sure you've completed <strong>Intro to C++</strong> as we'll be using the Serial prints that was covered there.

In programming, variables are used to store values.
These values can be of different types, such as integers, floats, and strings.

## Defining Variables

In C++, we must define the the variables before we can use them. To illustrate, try the following example...

```cpp hl_lines="1 2 3 4 5 6 7  "
int foo1 = 100;
unsigned int foo2 = 60000;
long foo3 = 2000000000;
float foo4 = 123.456;
char foo5 = 'A';
String foo6 = "Hello World";
bool foo7 = true;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  Serial.println(foo1);
  Serial.println(foo2);
  Serial.println(foo3);
  Serial.println(foo4);
  Serial.println(foo5);
  Serial.println(foo6);
  Serial.println(foo7);
  delay(5000);
}
```

**int foo1 = 100** : This defines the variable **foo1** as type **int** (integer) and a starting value of 100.
**foo1** is the name of the variable, and you can use (almost) any name you want, as long as it starts with a alphabet and does not contain spaces or special characters.
On most Arduinos, an **int** is a 16-bits value, and it can store a number that ranges from -32,768 to 32,767.
It can only store integers (...whole numbers), and cannot store non-integer numbers such as **1.2** or **45.6**.

**unsigned int foo2** : This defines the variable **foo2** as type **unsigned int** (unsigned integer).
On most Arduinos, an unsigned integer is a 16-bits value, and it can store a number that ranges from 0 to 65,535.
It can store numbers twice the size of **int**, but cannot store negative numbers.

**long foo3** : This defines a the variable **foo3** as type **long** (long integer).
On most Arduinos, an **int** is a 16-bits value, and it can store a number that ranges from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
There is also an unsigned version of long (**unsigned long**) that allows you to store numbers twice the size, at the cost of being unable to handle negative numbers.

**float foo4** : This defines the variable **foo4** as type **float** (floating point number), a number that has a decimal point.
A floating point number has around 6-7 decimal digits of precision.
That's the total number of digits, not the number to the right of the decimal point.
It can store a number that ranges from -3.4028235E+38 to 3.4028235E+38.

**char foo5 = 'A'** : This defines the variable **foo5** as type **char** (character).
**char** are used to store a single character.
Note that when specifying the value for the character, we use single quotes **'A'**; double quotes are used for strings.

**String foo6 = "Hello World"** : This defines the variable **foo6** as type **String**.
Strings are used to store words, sentences, or paragraphs, and when specifying the value for a String, we use double quotes **"Hello World"**.

**bool foo7 = true** : This defines the variable **foo6** as type **bool** (boolean).
Booleans have only two possible values; **true** or **false**.

## Variable Scope

In the above example, all of the variables are defined outside of **setup** and **loop**.
Such variables are called **global variables**, and they can be used in any functions.

Functions that are defined inside of a function are called **local variables**, and they can only be used within that function itself.
Here's an example that illustrates the difference...

```cpp hl_lines="1 4 7 8 9 13 14"
int foo1 = 100;

void setup() {
  int foo2 = 200;
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Both foo1 and foo2 can be used here
  Serial.println(foo1);
  Serial.println(foo2);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println(foo1);
  Serial.println(foo2); // This line will cause an error as foo2 isn't available outside of setup.
  delay(5000);
}
```

The above code won't work as **foo2** is defined inside of **setup**, so it cannot be used in **loop**.
If you remove the **Serial.println(foo2);** in **loop**, the code will then work.
