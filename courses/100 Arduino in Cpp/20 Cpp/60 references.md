While going through this section of the course, you have encountered built-in functions such as **delay** and **Serial.println**.
These are just a few of the many built-in functions available in the Arduino platform.
As well, we have only touched on some of the basic features in C++, and there are much more to the C++ programming language that we have not covered.

## Arduino

Even the most experienced programmer cannot remember all details of the Arduino built-in functions, so it's important for us to learn to refer to the Arduino documentations. Open the following link in a new tab, and refer to it often when programming.

[Arduino Language Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)

## C++

For the C++ programming language, you can use the following tutorials to learn more

[learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/) This is actually a tutorial for C, not C++, but nearly everything in C applies to C++ as well.
It's a relatively easy to follow tutorial with an interactive tool that lets you test your code in the browser.
Note that the **printf** statements in the tutorials needs to be replaced with **Serial.print** if you are using an Arduino.

[Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/) This is a much longer tutorial for C++.
The tutorial expects you to install compilers and IDE on you computer to try the examples, but you can also use a free online compiler like [onlinegdb](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) instead.
