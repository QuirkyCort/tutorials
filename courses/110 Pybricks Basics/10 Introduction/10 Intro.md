# Introduction

This course covers the basics of Python and Pybricks.
It is suitable for students with zero knowledge of either of these.

## What is Pybricks?

Pybricks is an alternative firmware for the Lego EV3 and Spike Prime.
It provides a set of API (Application Programming Interface) to control the motors and sensors.

<div class="note">
An API is basically a collection of functions that you can use to control another software (...in this case, Pybricks).
</div>

Note that the Spike Prime comes with its own version of Python; this is not the same as Pybricks.
There really isn't any significant advantages to using one over the other, but this course is targeted at Pybricks and will not cover the usage of the Spike Python API.
