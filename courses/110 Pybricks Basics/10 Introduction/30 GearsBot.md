# Using GearsBot

Not everyone will have a robot ready, and practicing on a real robot can be slow (...need to connect, download, grab the robot when it falls off the table, charge battteries...).

Using [GearsBot](https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/) can make it easier to practice.
All of the examples in this tutorial can work in GearsBot.

When using GearsBot, please note the following...

* Motor/Sensor ports in GearsBot may not match your actual robot; don't copy the code to your robot and expect to work immediately.

* GearsBot provides a bunch of functions to replicate the "move_tank" and "move_steering" capability that's missing from Pybricks; You can delete or ignore them if you don't want to use them.
