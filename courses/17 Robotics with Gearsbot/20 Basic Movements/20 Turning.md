# Turning

If we want the robot to move to the right, we'll need to tell it to turn right first.

Drag a `Turn Right` block, and place it between `When Started` and `Move Forward`.

Your robot will now turn right, before moving forward.

Naturally, if you want your robot to turn left, you should use a `Turn Left` block.
