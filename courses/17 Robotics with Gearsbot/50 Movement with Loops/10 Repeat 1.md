# Repeat (Part 1)

To repeat something, we can use the `repeat` block, which is found under the `Loops` category.

Any blocks that you put inside the `repeat` block will be repeated by the specified number of times.

## Example

For each of these challenges, you'll need to complete the challenge using as few blocks as possible.

- [Example challenge](https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2Ftf8wy6qAVo.json&filterBlocksJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2FESbF3weeEV.json&worldScripts=challenges_basic)

Make sure to click the *Mission* button to see how many blocks you are allowed to use.

You can solve this easily using just `Turn Right` and `Move Forward` blocks...

...but you'll use too many blocks this way.

### Repeat

Can you find the pattern in the earlier solution?

We can make use of patterns to simplify this solution!

## Challenges

For each challenge, click on the *Simulator Tab*, then the *Mission* button to see the mission you need to do.
Each challenge will have a different blocks limit, so make sure to check each time!
