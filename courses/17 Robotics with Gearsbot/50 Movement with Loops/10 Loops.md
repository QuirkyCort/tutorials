# Loops

To repeat something, we can use the `repeat` block, which is found under the `Loops` category.

Any blocks that you put inside the `repeat` block will be repeated by the specified number of times.

## Example

For each of these challenges, you'll need to complete the challenge using as few blocks as possible.

- [Example challenge](https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/index.html?worldJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2Ftf8wy6qAVo.json&filterBlocksJSON=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.aposteriori.com.sg%2Fget%2FESbF3weeEV.json&worldScripts=challenges_basic)

Make sure to click the *Mission* button to see how many blocks you are allowed to use.

You can solve this easily using just `Turn Right` and `Move Forward` blocks...

...but you'll use too many blocks this way.

### Repeat

Can you find the pattern in the earlier solution?

### Loops Challenge 1

- Tip: There's no need to sleep inside the block if your robot ends its program inside it.

### Loops Challenge 3

- Hint: You may need to use more than one repeat loop. Also, it's ok to make an extra turn if it helps you stay within the blocks limit.

### Loops Challenge 4

- Hint: Not every block needs to be inside a loop.
