Challenges and Bugs
===

There are many areas where the game can be improved. You can attempt the following in any order.

### Bugfixes
* There is at least one bug in the program. Can you find and fix it? *Hint: It sometimes occurs upon game over.*

### Power-ups
* **Multi-drones** : Currently, you can only pick up one drone. Can you enhance the program so that picking up multiple strawberry donuts will give you more drones?
* **Shield** : Can you add another power up that gives your ship a shield? The shield should disappear after blocking one bullet.
  * **Shield+** : Enhance the shield code, so that you can pickup multiple powerups to strengthen the shield.
* **Bomb** : Can you add a bomb power up that destroys all enemies on screen when it is picked up?

### Multi-player
* Can you add a second player?

### Enemies
* **Tough Enemy** : Create an enemy that takes mutiple bullets to destroy.
* **Shooter Enemy** : Create an enemy that shoots bullets continuously in all directions.
* **Boss Enemy** : Create a boss enemy. Research on how the boss enemy in Twin Bee behaves (...you can look at YouTube videos) for your reference.

### Difficulty
* Make the difficulty increase with time. How can you make the game harder?

### Start screen and levels
* Create a start screen for the game. The actual game should only start when you click the "Start" icon on the start screen.
* Create multiple levels. You can change the background and types of enemies for each level.

### Multiple lives
* Give your player multiple lives (...maybe 3 lives). The game should end only when all 3 lives are lost.

### Graphical Effects
These may not affect the gameplay, but can make the game look better.

* Add some drifting clouds.
* Add some animated images in the background (eg. turning windmill).
