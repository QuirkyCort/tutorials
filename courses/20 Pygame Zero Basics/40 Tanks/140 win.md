Destroy and Win
===
Right now, our bullet can destroy the wall, but does nothing to the enemy tank. Let's change that!

```python
enemy_index = bullet.collidelist(enemies)
if enemy_index != -1:
    del enemies[enemy_index]
    bullets.remove(bullet)
```

This code is the same as what we have for the wall, but with the list changes to **enemies** instead. With this, you can now destroy the enemy tanks!

Winning
===
We should win the game when all the enemy tanks are destroyed. We can count the number of enemy tanks remaining in the **enemies** list using **len(enemies)**.

Change **draw()** to...

```python
def draw():
    if len(enemies) == 0:
        screen.fill((0,0,0))
        screen.draw.text('You Win!', (260,250), color=(255,255,255), fontsize=100)
    else:
        background.draw()
        tank.draw()
        for enemy in enemies:
            enemy.draw()
        for bullet in bullets:
            bullet.draw()
        for bullet in enemy_bullets:
            bullet.draw()
        for wall in walls:
            wall.draw()
```

The new code...

```python
if len(enemies) == 0:
    screen.draw.text('You Win!', (260,250), color=(255,255,255), fontsize=100)
```

Checks if the number of enemies is zero. If it is, it'll fill the screen with black and draw the words "You Win!" in white.

The parameters of **screen.draw.text** are...

'You Win!'' : This is the string that we want to draw.

(260,250) : This is the position to draw; x=260 and y=250.

color=(255,255,255) : This is the color of the text, in this case, it is white

fontsize=100 : The size of the font.
